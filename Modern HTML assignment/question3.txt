Accessibility in the context of Web-development refers to the practise of designing and developing 
websites and web-applications in such a way that ensures people with hearing, sight or other type of
disabilities to percieve, navigate, interact and understand the content effectively without any difficulty.

it is essential to create accessible websites because a website is used by a large number of peoples
and some of them are not comfortable with non-accessible websites due to their sight, hearing or 
other diffrent types of disabilities.
So, it always becomes a prime responsibility of a developer to make accessible websites that can easily
be used by people having certain kinds of disabilities.

Creation of more and more Accessible websites definetely benifits diffrent user groups that includes 
user groups having certain disability in percieving content.
For EG: A user group having sight disability will be grately beniffited by the accessible website that
that has screen reader inculcated in it.
