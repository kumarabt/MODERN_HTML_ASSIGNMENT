The 3 ways in which we can improve the accessibility of HTML are as follows:

1. We can use the newly introduced semantic tags in our html code to appropriately convey the meaning and 
structure of the content present in our web page. We can use tags like <main>, <aside>, <nav>, <section>,
<header> and <footer> semantic tags in our html code. Semantic markup in our html code helps screen readers
to understand the context and structure of our content in website and that improves the accessibility of
our website.

2. By providing alternative text to images, as it provides the textual description of image to visually
disabled people and hence, improving the accessibility of our website also when the image fails to load
alt attribute provides a textual description of the image to the user.

3. Also, we can link our label tag's for attribute to input tag id attribute by providing them the same
value, this will link both label and input fields in forms together. This helps screen readers to provide
context of form fields to peoples with some disability and hence, improves the accessibility of our 
website.
