    <header><u><h1>3 KEY FEATURES OF HTML5</h1></u></header>
    <main>
        <h2>1.SEMANTIC TAGS:</h2> HTML5 introduced a new set of semantic tags that is used to create meaningful webpages.
                  Since, previously only div tag can be used as a container as we define class in that 
                  as header, footer, and nav etc. in it. But, now after HTML5 we can directly used tags
                  like &ltheader&gt,&ltfooter&gt,&ltarticle&gt,&ltnav&gt and &ltsection&gt etc. and can add meaning to our webpages.
                  this provides better clarity of content type and helps in organization of content, that 
                  makes it easier for search engines and web crawlers to understand and interpret web page
                  structure.
            <br/><br/>

        <h2>2. AUDIO AND VIDEO SUPPORT:</h2>HTML5 includes inbuilt support for audio and video elements through the 
        &ltaudio&gt and &ltvideo&gt tags. This eliminates the need for third party plugins
        like Adobe Flash, that's need to be done previously. And allow developers to
        embed audio and video content directly into the web pages.
        <br/><br/>

        <h2>3.HTML FORM ADVANCEMENTS:</h2>HTML5 introduced several form input types and attributes that improves user
        experience and validation. New input types include 'email','url','number'
        'date' and 'range' etc. which help browsers to provide better input validation.
        Additionally, HTML5 also introduced 'placeholder' attribute in input fields and
        the required 'attribute' for mandatory form fields, and the &ltdatalist>&gt
        element for providing predefined options for input fields.
