                    our diffrent content sections.
                </td>
                <td>1. HTML5 introduced various semantic tags that provide meaning and structure to our
                    content. <br/>for eg: section tag, nav tag, main tag, header and footer tag etc.

                Only jpeg and png formats can be used which becomes ruptures  when image <br/> height 
            and width are increased</td>
                <td>2. HTML introduced users to new advanced graphics tags like SVG and CANVAS <br/>
                that resolved the problem of image rupturing at large height and width.</td>

                <td>3. Previously HTML doesn't have inbuilt audio and video support in it. <br/>
                So, we have to use third party plugins like adobe flash for audio and video support.  </td>
                <td>3. HTML5 on the other hand has inbuilt audio and video support in it. <br>
                That, can be accessed by using audio and video tags in HTML5.</td>
